# Wedding Landing Page Project

This is a Next.js project built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS for creating a wedding planning landing page.

## Project Structure

- Uses App Router (Next.js 13+ features)
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Components are located in `src/components/`
- Main pages are in `src/app/`

## Styling Guidelines

- Use TailwindCSS classes exclusively
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Use consistent spacing and color schemes suitable for wedding themes
- Prefer soft, romantic color palettes (pastels, elegant tones)

## Component Guidelines

- Export components as default exports
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility

## Wedding Theme Considerations

- Design should evoke elegance and romance
- Use appropriate imagery placeholders
- Focus on user experience for event planning workflows
- Include clear call-to-action buttons for conversions
